# Double-Card-Game-using-Heuristic-Minimax-search-with-Alpha-Beta-pruning-
The first project of the course "Introduction to AI" at Concordia Univeristy

1. In the program, there are three heuristics h1, h1_2 and h2. 
2. There are three Minimax-ab functions: Minimax-ab(),Minimax-ab2(),Minimax-ab3(). 
3. h1 and h1_2 should be called by Minimax-ab();   h2 should be called by Minimax-ab2().
4. Minimax-ab3() is the algorithm with a visited table, can call h1 and h1_2.
5. When the program asks "If open transposition input 1, otherwise 0: "  input 0, clsoe the visited table.
